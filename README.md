Creating a 3D cube using Vulkan with Wayland requires creating a Wayland window and managing the rendering context. Here's an outline of the process:

1.  Install required SDK and libraries:
    
    *   Install Vulkan SDK: [https://vulkan.lunarg.com/sdk/home](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/sdk/home)
    *   Install Wayland development libraries. On a Debian-based system, you can use the following command:
        
        arduinoCopy code
        
        `sudo apt-get install libwayland-dev`
        
2.  Configure development environment:
    
    *   Create a new project in your preferred development environment (IDE).
    *   Add the headers and libraries of the Vulkan SDK and Wayland to the project.
3.  Create a custom window using Wayland:
    
    *   Initialize the Wayland display and registry.
    *   Create a Wayland compositor and shell.
    *   Create a Wayland surface and shell surface.
    *   Implement a basic event loop for handling input and window events.
4.  Initialize Vulkan:
    
    *   Check if the hardware and software support the minimum Vulkan version.
    *   Create a Vulkan instance and select a validation function (if needed).
    *   Choose a physical device (GPU) and its properties.
    *   Create a logical device and set its properties.
5.  Prepare Vulkan resources:
    
    *   Create a swapchain and configure its properties.
    *   Create image buffers and image views.
    *   Create the graphics pipeline, including vertex and fragment shaders.
    *   Create a descriptor set to pass information to the shaders.
    *   Define memory layout and create vertex and index buffers.
6.  Create the 3D cube:
    
    *   Define the cube vertices and indices.
    *   Create a vertex buffer and fill it with vertex data.
    *   Create an index buffer and fill it with index data.
    *   Implement your own transformation and projection matrix functions to replace GLM. You can use custom math libraries or implement your own linear algebra functions.
7.  Rendering loop:
    
    *   Start the rendering loop, which will continue until the window is closed.
    *   For each frame, acquire an image from the swapchain.
    *   Submit rendering commands to the image using a graphics queue.
    *   Present the rendered image in the window using a presentation queue.
    *   Synchronize rendering and presentation using semaphores and/or fences.
8.  Cleanup and shutdown:
    
    *   Release Vulkan resources and destroy created objects.
    *   Terminate the Wayland library and close the window.
